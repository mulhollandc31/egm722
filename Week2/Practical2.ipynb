    "# Practical 2 - Mapping with cartopy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first practical for EGM711, you learned how to use ArcGIS Pro to make maps, given shapefiles of different features of interest in Northern Ireland. In this practical, you will repeat the exercise, this time using `cartopy`, `geopandas`, and `matplotlib`, three python packages used for making maps, working with vector data, and making plots, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- become familiar with geopandas, cartopy, and matplotlib, including reading the provided documentation\n",
    "- use list comprehensions to simplify some for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Getting started\n",
    "First, run the cell below. It will load the python modules we'll be using in the practical, as well as define a few helper functions that we'll use later on. For now, don't worry too much about what each individual line does - we'll go over these in a bit more depth as we go. Remember also that if you get stuck, you can get help in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the built-in help (i.e., `help(plt.text)`)\n",
    "2. using ipython's (the python interpreter used by jupyter-notebooks) help shortcut (i.e., `plt.text?`)\n",
    "3. finding the online documentation for the module (usually achieved via option 4)\n",
    "4. searching google (or your search engine of choice)\n",
    "5. consulting your favorite medicine man/shaman/spiritual guide\n",
    "6. asking the instructor, who will in all likelihood resort to one of the other options (usually 5 or 4)."

As a further exercise, see if you can modify the script to plot all of the __Towns__ with one marker (e.g., the gray square used above), and plot all of the __Cities__ plot with a different marker, then add these to the legend. For more information on the available markers and colors for matplotlib, see the [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html)."
